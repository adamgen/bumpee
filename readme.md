# Bumpee

A small interface for bumping versions

## Semver

Semver (stands for Semantic Versioning) and is convention for managing version names. In semver the version has three parts, each part is a number separated by a dot. Example: 1.0.34.

The three parts represent the magnitude of the changes made this version. Each part has a name:

1. Major - changes when there are breaking changes.
2. Minor - changes when there are updates like added functionality, but without breaking changes.
3. Patch - changes for bug fixes and no functionality is touched.
